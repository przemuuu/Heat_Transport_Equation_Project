# Heat Transport Equation Project - Differential Equations
### C++ language

### Task given:

Please solve the following differential equation using the finite element method:

$$ (a(x)u′(x))′ + b(x)u′(x) + c(x)u(x) = f(x) $$

by applying the heat transport equation.


### Formulas:
The formula has been derived in the PDF file. It also contains screenshots of the code with brief descriptions of their functionality.

### Usage:
The parameter "n" must be provided, representing the number of elements in the system of equations.

### Results:
The console outputs (x, y) points, which are the solutions to the given system of equations.
Additionally, five plot windows (generated using the gnuplot library) will open:

- Solution plot of the problem
- Plot of all elements
- Derivative of the first element
- Derivative of the middle element
- Derivative of the last element

### Libraries used:
